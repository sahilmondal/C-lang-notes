        <h2>What is C language?</h2>
        <p>
          C is a high-level programming language developed in the 1970s for
          system programming and writing operating systems. It is widely used
          for developing system software, embedded systems, and games.

        <h2>What are the features of C language?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Low-level access to memory</p></li>
          <li><p>Pointers for dynamic memory allocation</p></li>
          <li><p>Structured programming constructs</p></li>

        <h2>What is a variable in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value
          that can be modified during the execution of a program. The value
          stored in a variable can be accessed and used by different parts of a
          program.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a local and a global variable in C
          language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A local variable is a variable declared inside a function and its
          scope is limited to that function. On the other hand, a global
          variable is a variable declared outside any function and its scope is
          the entire program. Global variables can be accessed from any part of
          the program, while local variables can only be accessed within the
          function where they are declared.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a constant and a variable in C
          language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A constant is a value that cannot be modified during the execution of
          a program, while a variable is a value that can be changed. Constants
          are declared using the keyword "const," while variables are declared
          using regular variable declaration statements.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is an operator in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific
          mathematical or logical manipulations. Operators in C include
          arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators,
          assignment operators, and more.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is an expression in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators
          that are evaluated to produce a result. Expressions can be used to
          perform calculations, assign values to variables, and more.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is the difference between ++i and i++ in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          The difference between ++i and i++ is in the order in which the
          increment operation is performed. In the case of ++i, the increment
          operation is performed before the value is used in the expression,
          while in the case of i++, the increment operation is performed after
          the value is used in the expression.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a pointer in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another
          variable. Pointers allow you to access and manipulate the memory
          directly, which can be useful for tasks such as allocating and freeing
          memory dynamically, passing variables to functions by reference, and
          more.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a structure in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A structure in C is a user-defined data type that groups together
          different variables under a single name. Structures allow you to
          define complex data types and represent real-world objects in your
          program with their properties and attributes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a union in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A union in C is a user-defined data type that is similar to a
          structure, but with a different memory allocation strategy. Unlike
          structures, unions use the same memory location for all their
          variables, so only one variable can hold a value at any given time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is an enumeration in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          An enumeration in C is a user-defined data type that consists of a set
          of named integer constants. Enumerations are often used to define
          named constants in your program, making it easier to understand and
          maintain your code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is an array in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          An array in C is a collection of elements of the same data type,
          stored in contiguous memory locations and accessed using a common name
          and an index. Arrays allow you to store and manipulate collections of
          data in your program.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a function in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A function in C is a self-contained block of code that performs a
          specific task. Functions can accept input parameters, return values,
          and be called from other parts of the program. Functions allow you to
          modularize your code, making it easier to understand, test, and reuse.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a call by value and a call by reference
          in C language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In a call by value, the value of the argument is passed to the
          function, and any changes made to the argument inside the function do
          not affect the value of the original argument. In a call by reference,
          a reference to the memory location of the argument is passed to the
          function, allowing the function to directly manipulate the value
          stored at that memory location.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a preprocessor directive in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A preprocessor directive in C is a line of code that begins with a
          hash symbol (#) and is processed by the C preprocessor before the
          actual compilation of the program. Preprocessor directives are used to
          include header files, define macros, and perform other tasks that need
          to be done before the actual compilation of the program.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a header file in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A header file in C is a file that contains declarations for functions,
          variables, and other elements that can be used in multiple source
          files. Header files are typically included in your program using the
          #include preprocessor directive, and allow you to write modular,
          reusable code by defining common elements in a single file that can be
          used across your program.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is the use of the main() function in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          The main() function in C is the entry point of your program, where the
          execution of your code begins. The main() function is called by the
          operating system when your program is run, and it contains the code
          that defines the behavior of your program. The main() function is
          required in every C program, and it can accept arguments and return a
          value to indicate the success or failure of the program.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between local and global variables in C
          language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Local variables in C are variables that are declared within a function
          and are only accessible within that function. Global variables in C
          are variables that are declared outside of any function, and are
          accessible from any function in your program. Global variables can be
          accessed and modified from any part of your program, but their values
          persist only for the duration of the program, whereas local variables
          are created and destroyed each time the function is called.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a while loop and a for loop in C
          language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A while loop in C repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a
          condition is true, whereas a for loop in C allows you to execute a
          block of code a specific number of times. The for loop also provides a
          more concise syntax for initializing variables, specifying the
          conditions for executing the loop, and incrementing variables each
          iteration.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is the difference between ++i and i++ in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          The ++ operator in C can be used as either a pre-increment (++i) or a
          post-increment (i++). The difference between the two is that in a
          pre-increment, the value of the variable is incremented before it is
          used in an expression, whereas in a post-increment, the value of the
          variable is incremented after it is used in an expression. This can
          have an impact on the order of evaluation of expressions, and the
          final value of the variable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a null pointer in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A null pointer in C is a special value that is assigned to a pointer
          variable when it does not point to any valid memory location. The null
          pointer is typically represented by a constant with the value 0, and
          is used to indicate the absence of a valid memory location, for
          example, when initializing a pointer that does not point to any
          memory, or when a function returns a null pointer to indicate an error
          condition.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a static variable and a dynamic
          variable in C language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A static variable in C retains its value between function calls,
          whereas a dynamic variable is created and destroyed each time the
          function is called. Dynamic variables are typically created using
          malloc() or calloc() functions, and must be explicitly deallocated
          using the free() function when they are no longer needed. Static
          variables are typically declared within a function using the static
          keyword, and are only accessible within that function. The memory for
          a static variable is allocated when the program starts and is never
          freed, which makes it ideal for maintaining state across multiple
          function calls, while dynamic variables are better suited for
          allocating memory on-the-fly as needed, and freeing it when it is no
          longer needed to conserve system resources.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a function prototype in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A function prototype in C is a declaration of a function that
          specifies the function name, the number and type of arguments that the
          function takes, and the type of value that the function returns.
          Function prototypes are typically placed in header files, and are used
          to declare functions that are defined in other source files, or to
          declare functions that are implemented in libraries. Function
          prototypes are also used to ensure that the function calls in your
          program match the function definitions, and to enforce type safety by
          checking that the arguments passed to the function match the expected
          types.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between call by value and call by reference in
          C language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Call by value in C is a method of passing arguments to a function
          where the value of the argument is copied into a function-local
          variable, and the function operates on the local copy of the data.
          Call by reference in C is a method of passing arguments to a function
          where the address of the argument is passed, and the function operates
          directly on the original data. Call by reference can be used to pass
          large structures or arrays as arguments to functions, or to return
          multiple values from a function, as any changes made to the data in
          the function will persist after the function returns.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a null character and a newline
          character in C language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A null character in C is a special character with the value 0 that is
          used to indicate the end of a string. The null character is typically
          used to terminate strings in C, as string functions in C rely on the
          presence of a null character to determine the end of a string. A
          newline character in C is a character that represents a line break in
          a text file, and is typically represented by '\n' in C. Newline
          characters are used to separate lines of text in files, or to format
          output in the terminal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a conditional operator in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A conditional operator in C is a shorthand operator that allows you to
          write an if-else statement in a single line. The conditional operator
          takes three operands, a condition, and two values, and returns the
          value of the second operand if the condition is true, and the value of
          the third operand if the condition is false. The syntax for a
          conditional operator in C is: condition ? value1 : value2, where
          condition is a Boolean expression, and value1 and value2 are the
          values to be returned if the condition is true or false, respectively.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a break statement and a continue
          statement in C language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A break statement in C is used to exit a loop or a switch statement
          prematurely, whereas a continue statement in C is used to skip the
          current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration. The
          break statement is typically used when a certain condition is met, and
          you want to exit the loop or switch statement, whereas the continue
          statement is used when a certain condition is met, and you want to
          skip the current iteration and continue to the next iteration. Both
          the break and continue statements are useful for controlling the flow
          of a loop, and allow you to write more complex and flexible algorithms
          in C.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is the use of a typedef in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A typedef in C is a keyword that allows you to create a new type name
          for an existing type. Typedefs are used to make code more readable, by
          giving descriptive names to complex or hard-to-read types, or to
          simplify the declaration of common types. For example, instead of
          using the type 'unsigned int' for a variable, you can use the typedef
          'uint' to declare the variable, making the code more concise and
          easier to read. Typedefs can be used with any type, including
          primitive types, structures, and arrays, and can make your code more
          maintainable and less prone to errors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a preprocessor directive and a normal
          statement in C language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A preprocessor directive in C is a special instruction to the C
          preprocessor, which is a program that processes the source code before
          it is compiled. Preprocessor directives are typically indicated by a
          '#' symbol at the beginning of a line, and are used to include header
          files, define macros, or control the conditional compilation of source
          code. A normal statement in C is a line of code that is executed by
          the program at runtime, and can include assignments, function calls,
          or control statements like 'if' or 'while'. The main difference
          between a preprocessor directive and a normal statement is that
          preprocessor directives are processed before the program is compiled,
          while normal statements are executed at runtime.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>What is the purpose of the 'volatile' keyword in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          The volatile keyword in C is used to declare a variable that may be
          changed by an external source, such as a hardware device or another
          thread. This informs the compiler that it should not optimize the code
          that uses the volatile variable, as the value of the variable may
          change unexpectedly. The use of the volatile keyword is important in
          embedded systems programming, where variables may be modified by
          hardware devices or other interrupt-driven sources. Without the
          volatile keyword, the compiler may optimize the code and produce
          incorrect results, as it assumes that the value of the variable will
          not change unexpectedly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the difference between a 'structure' and a 'union' in C
          language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In C, a structure is a collection of variables of different data
          types, grouped together under a single name. A structure is used to
          represent a complex data structure, such as a point in 2D space, a
          record in a database, or a student's name and grade. A union, on the
          other hand, is a special type of structure that allows multiple
          variables to share the same memory location. This means that the size
          of a union is equal to the size of its largest member, and that only
          one member of the union can be accessed at a time. Unions are used to
          save memory and to implement type punning, where the same memory
          location is interpreted as different data types at different times.
          The choice between a structure and a union depends on the desired
          behavior and the purpose of the data structure.

        <h2>
          What is the difference between a 'while' loop and a 'do-while' loop in
          C language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In C, a while loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a
          block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The condition
          is evaluated before each iteration of the loop, and the loop is
          terminated if the condition becomes false. A do-while loop is similar
          to a while loop, but the condition is evaluated after the first
          iteration of the loop. This means that the code in a do-while loop is
          guaranteed to be executed at least once, even if the condition is
          false. The choice between a while loop and a do-while loop depends on
          the desired behavior and the purpose of the loop. If you want to
          execute the loop at least once regardless of the condition, then you
          can use a do-while loop. If you want the loop to execute only if the
          condition is true, then you can use a while loop.

        <h2>What is the purpose of the 'typedef' keyword in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          The typedef keyword in C is used to define a new data type that is an
          alias for an existing data type. This allows you to create custom data
          types that are more meaningful and easier to read. For example, you
          can use typedef to define a new data type 'distance' that is an alias
          for the data type 'float', or to define a new data type 'age' that is
          an alias for the data type 'int'. Using typedef can make your code
          more readable, as it allows you to use more meaningful names for data
          types, rather than the raw data types themselves.

        <h2>
          What is the difference between a 'for' loop and a 'while' loop in C
          language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In C, a for loop and a while loop are both control structures that are
          used to execute a block of code repeatedly. The main difference
          between the two is that a for loop is typically used when the number
          of iterations is known in advance, whereas a while loop is used when
          the number of iterations is not known. A for loop contains an explicit
          loop counter or loop variable, which is updated on each iteration of
          the loop, whereas a while loop only contains a condition that is
          evaluated before each iteration of the loop. The choice between a for
          loop and a while loop depends on the desired behavior and the purpose
          of the loop.

        <h2>What is the purpose of the 'goto' statement in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          The goto statement in C is used to transfer control to a different
          part of the program, bypassing any intermediate statements. The goto
          statement is often considered to be a bad programming practice, as it
          can make the code more difficult to read and maintain. The goto
          statement is generally used in very rare cases, such as to exit
          multiple nested loops, or to handle error conditions. If possible, it
          is recommended to use more structured control structures, such as
          if-else statements, loops, and functions, instead of goto statements.

      <li>
        <h2>What is the purpose of the 'const' keyword in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          The const keyword in C is used to declare a constant value. When a
          variable is declared as const, its value cannot be changed during the
          execution of the program. This makes the variable a read-only
          variable, which can be useful in certain situations to prevent
          accidental modification of important values. For example, if you have
          a constant value that represents the value of pi, you can declare it
          as a const variable to ensure that its value cannot be changed
          accidentally. By using const, you can improve the reliability and
          maintainability of your code, as it makes it easier to catch and
          prevent accidental changes to important values.

        <h2>
          What is the purpose of the 'break' and 'continue' statements in C
          language?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The break and continue statements in C are used to control the flow of
          execution in loops. The break statement is used to exit a loop
          prematurely, before all of the iterations have been completed. The
          continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop
          and move on to the next iteration. The break statement is typically
          used to exit a loop when a certain condition is met, such as when a
          search has found a result, or when an error has occurred. The continue
          statement is typically used to skip over invalid or unwanted values in
          a loop. By using break and continue, you can control the flow of
          execution in your loops, making it easier to write efficient and
          reliable code.
