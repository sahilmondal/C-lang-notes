        <h2>What is a file in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A file in C is a named collection of data that is stored on a
          secondary storage device such as a disk.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a conditional operator in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A conditional operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement,
          allowing a simple test and two possible expressions to be written in a
          single line.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a switch statement in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A switch statement allows a variable to be tested against multiple
          values, with a different block of code executed for each matching
          value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a while loop in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition is
          true.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a do-while loop in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, except that the loop body
          is executed at least once, and the condition is tested at the end of
          each iteration.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a for loop in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A for loop is a compact way to write a loop that repeatedly executes a
          block of code, with an explicit counter or loop variable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a function in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific
          task, and can be called from other parts of a program.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a function prototype in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A function prototype is a declaration of a function that specifies its
          return type, parameter types, and function name.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is recursion in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself, either
          directly or indirectly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a header file in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A header file is a file containing declarations that can be shared
          between multiple source files.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a dynamic library in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A dynamic library is a library that is loaded at runtime, rather than
          at compile time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a static library in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A static library is a library that is linked with a program at compile
          time, rather than being loaded at runtime.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a string in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A string is an array of characters terminated by a null character.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is a file in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          A file is a collection of data stored on a disk or other storage
          device.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What is file input/output in C language?</h2>
        <p>
          File input/output is the process of reading from or writing to a file
          on disk.
        </p>
